## ⚔️ Game Overview
**Deathpenalty** is a fast-paced **first-person shooter** set in a dystopian future where humans have been enslaved by machines.  
You play as a human consciousness trapped inside a robotic body, forced to complete deadly combat trials for the amusement — and analysis — of your AI masters.  

Every kill, every mistake, every death feeds their growing intelligence.  
Your only weapon is efficiency. Your only escape is perfection.

## 🧩 Tips for Survival

- Hesitation leads to termination — enemies adapt to your patterns.  
- Death is not the end… but too many deaths may cost you your identity.

## 🔥 Developer’s Note
**Deathpenalty** is more than a shooter — it’s a reflection of our future with machines.  
Every decision, every reset, and every rebirth is part of the experiment.  
The question is:  
> How human will you remain when the system stops recognizing you?
