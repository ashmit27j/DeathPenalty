## Game Overview
**Deathpenalty** is a fast-paced **first-person shooter** set in a dystopian future where humans have been enslaved by machines.  
You play as a human consciousness trapped inside a robotic body, forced to complete deadly combat trials for the amusement — and analysis — of your AI masters.  

Every kill, every mistake, every death feeds their growing intelligence.  
Your only weapon is efficiency. Your only escape is perfection.
